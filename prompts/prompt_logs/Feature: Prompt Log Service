Feature: Prompt Log Service
  As a Declarative Designer
  I want to log prompts and their responses in a centralized system
  So that I can reference them in the codebase and maintain traceability.

  Scenario: Log a new prompt
    Given I have a new prompt and its response
    When I log the prompt with a unique ID
    Then the prompt should be saved in the `prompts/` directory
    And the log should include the prompt, response, and code references

  Scenario: Reference a prompt in the codebase
    Given a prompt has been logged with a unique ID
    When I implement code based on the prompt
    Then I should reference the prompt ID as a comment in the code

  Scenario: Retrieve a prompt log
    Given a prompt has been logged with a unique ID
    When I retrieve the log for the prompt
    Then I should see the prompt, response, and code references

  Scenario: Automate prompt logging
    Given I have a new prompt and its response
    When I use the prompt logging script
    Then the script should generate a unique ID
    And save the prompt log in the `prompts/` directory
