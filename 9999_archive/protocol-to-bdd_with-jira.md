# ðŸ§¾ Duckie Design System Contract: Protocol-to-BDD Translation

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose
This contract defines how Duckie interprets structured UX artifacts (such as usability protocols) and transforms them into declarative, testable specifications using Behavior Driven Design (BDD) formats like Gherkin.

It is intended to formalize the behavior of Duckie as a platform that converts research-led intent into engineering-ready artifacts such as GitHub or Jira issues, `.feature` files, and BDD step definitions.

---

## ðŸ§© Accepted Input Types

Duckie can ingest the following UX artifact types:
- Usability protocols (Markdown or plaintext)
- Moderated testing scripts
- Research playbooks
- Annotated transcripts (coming soon)
- Gherkin `.feature` files (direct mode)

## ðŸ§­ Structural Mapping

| UX Protocol Element        | BDD Equivalent   | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Scenario              | `Feature:`       | High-level intent / job to be done                                    |
| Task Goal                 | `Scenario:`      | A testable intent within that context                                 |
| Task Steps                | `Given/When/Then`| Interpreted as observable system behavior                             |
| Success Criteria           | `Then` + Checks  | Reflected in expected outcomes or assertion logic                     |
| Assumptions/Constraints   | `Background:` or metadata | Used to define environment setup and scope                        |

---

## ðŸŽ› Fidelity Expectations

- At minimum, a protocol must include:
  - One user scenario
  - One task goal
  - Three or more task steps
- Optional but recommended:
  - Success criteria
  - Assumptions (for environment and persona scope)

## ðŸ¤– Duckie System Behavior

| Action                             | Behavior                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File upload or CLI prompt         | Duckie prompts the user to identify the file type                        |
| Protocol parsing (non-Gherkin)    | Uses LLM-assisted extraction to derive Feature, Scenario, Steps          |
| Preview mode                      | Duckie displays `.feature` output for confirmation                       |
| Issue destination selection       | User chooses either GitHub or Jira as the target issue system            |
| Issue generation (on confirm)     | Creates issues using predefined templates                                |
| Output storage                    | Saves `.feature` file locally or in project repo                         |
| Traceability                      | Links output issues back to the protocol source via metadata             |

---

## ðŸ›‘ User Guarantees

Duckie will:
- Never create issues without user confirmation
- Always display a dry-run preview before posting to GitHub or Jira
- Never overwrite `.feature` files unless explicitly allowed

## ðŸ”— Implementation Touchpoints

| Output                | Location                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `.feature` file      | Local output folder or repo      |
| GitHub Issues        | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`        |
| Jira Issues          | Jira project, mapped via config  |
| Step Definitions     | Added to BDD test runner         |
| CI/CD triggers       | Connected via Artee (optional)   |

## ðŸ“… Versioning and Extensibility

This contract will evolve over time to support:
- More input types (e.g., workshop notes, surveys)
- Auto-generated step implementations
- Reuse of common scenario components
- Multi-file protocols

To propose an extension, open an issue in the `shut-the-dux-up` repo and tag it with `design-contract`.
