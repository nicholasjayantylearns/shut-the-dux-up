# Utility: Follow Me â€“ BDD GitHub Issue Generator

# Goal:
# Build a utility to support BDD workflows using Behave + GitHub Issues.
# This tool will parse feature files and step definitions, and automate the creation of GitHub issues.

# Requirements:
# 1. For every .feature file in the repo:
#    - Parse the Gherkin syntax
#    - Identify each Given/When/Then step
#    - Map steps to functions in a step definition .py file
#    - Detect missing step implementations

# 2. For every step definition file (e.g., steps/*.py):
#    - Treat the file as an "Epic"
#    - Treat each function (i.e., step) as a "Story" (1 story point, ~3 hrs)
#    - Auto-generate GitHub issues for unimplemented or new steps
#    - Link these issues to their Epic (the step def file)

# 3. When all related issues for a step definition are closed:
#    - Auto-create a "Run Behave Tests" issue

# 4. Watch for updates to .feature or step def files:
#    - Create issues for any new or modified steps not yet implemented

# 5. This tool will live in this repo: https://github.com/nicholasjayantylearns/shut-the-dux-up

# Notes:
# - Use GitHub API to create and link issues.
# - Optional: Add tags/labels like `type:function`, `effort:1-point`, etc.
# - Consider CLI or Streamlit UI in future versions.
