# 🐣 Duckie

> _Teach me how to Duckie. Everybody DUX-y._

Duckie is the command-line cockpit for Declarative UX — where designers write like screenwriters and ship like engineers.

---

## 🧠 Vision

> As a designer, I want to describe the user experience without my hands leaving the keyboard.  
> I want to write it like a movie — and have the rest follow.

Duckie generates structured UX artifacts that trigger pipelines, tests, and issues as you declare behavior.  
You define the outcome. Duckie choreographs the rest.
