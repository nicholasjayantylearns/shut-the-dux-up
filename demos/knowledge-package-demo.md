## Usage Examples

### For Engineering Teams
```javascript
const emergencyProtocols = require('@knowledge/emergency-response-protocols');

// Get validated response thresholds
const thresholds = emergencyProtocols.getMagnitudeThresholds();
// Returns: { stop_all_trains: 5.3, slow_and_inspect: "4.8-5.2", normal_ops: "<4.0" }

// Get proven training methodology  
const training = emergencyProtocols.getTrainingProtocol();
// Returns: 3-phase approach with timing and validation methods
```

### For Product Teams
```javascript
// Check evidence strength for decision confidence
const evidence = emergencyProtocols.getEvidenceStrength();
// Returns: { strength: "high", participant_coverage: 8, confidence: 0.87 }

// Get expansion roadmap based on real implementations
const roadmap = emergencyProtocols.getExpansionPlan();
// Returns: validated scaling approach from pilot to system-wide
```
