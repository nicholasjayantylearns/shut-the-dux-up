# ðŸ“„ Report Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
A **Report** represents a collection of **Data** objects organized into a structured document or dataset for analysis and presentation. It serves as the organizational unit that groups related evidence points, enabling researchers to create comprehensive reports, transcripts, or datasets that can be analyzed and shared.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to organize multiple data points into a structured report or dataset, I want to create a report collection that groups related evidence and provides context, so that I can analyze patterns across multiple data sources and present findings in a coherent, actionable format.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Report Object Matters
- Provides structured organization for multiple data points and evidence
- Enables comprehensive analysis across related evidence sources
- Supports pattern recognition and synthesis across multiple data points
- Creates the foundation for research reporting and knowledge sharing
- Allows researchers to maintain context and relationships between evidence

## ðŸ”— Structural Role & Usage Notes
- A **Report** groups multiple **Data** objects into structured collections for analysis
- Report types help categorize different kinds of research outputs (transcripts, datasets, analyses)
- Report status tracking enables workflow management for research deliverables
- Key findings provide high-level insights that emerge from the grouped data
- Reports can be associated with specific studies for organizational context
- Report structure helps organize complex research findings into digestible formats
