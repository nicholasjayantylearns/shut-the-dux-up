# 🔍 Evidence Junction Object

## 🎯 Purpose & Strategic Role
An **Evidence Junction** represents the connection between a **Session** and **Frame** object, creating a strategic analysis unit with a compelling teaser quote. It serves as the bridge that applies strategic lenses to research activities, enabling focused interpretation and synthesis of evidence through specific business contexts.

## 🧠 "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to analyze research session data through a specific strategic frame, I want to create an evidence junction that captures the most compelling insights with a teaser quote, so that I can generate focused, actionable findings that align with business objectives and strategic priorities.

## 💡 Why the Evidence Junction Object Matters
- Applies strategic frames to research sessions for focused analysis
- Captures compelling teaser quotes that highlight key insights
- Enables evidence synthesis through specific business lenses
- Supports strategic alignment between research findings and business objectives
- Creates the foundation for insight generation with clear strategic context
