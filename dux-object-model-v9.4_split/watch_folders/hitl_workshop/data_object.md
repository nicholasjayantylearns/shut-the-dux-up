# ðŸ“Š Data Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
A **Data** object represents the atomic unit of research reports, sources, and raw information - a single, discrete piece of evidence or finding extracted from research activities. It serves as the fundamental building block for all research insights, capturing specific quotes, observations, metrics, or findings that can be analyzed and synthesized.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to capture a specific piece of research evidence or finding, I want to record the atomic unit of information with full context and source attribution, so that I can build traceable evidence chains and support research claims with concrete, verifiable data points.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Data Object Matters
- Provides atomic evidence units that can be combined into larger insights
- Enables precise attribution and traceability of research findings
- Supports evidence synthesis and pattern recognition across multiple sources
- Creates the foundation for evidence maturity assessment and quality scoring
- Allows researchers to validate claims through direct reference to source material

## ðŸ”— Structural Role & Usage Notes
- A **Data** object is the atomic unit of evidence that feeds into **Provenance** objects
- Data objects are generated by **Session** objects and can be grouped into **Report** or **Transcript** collections
- Data objects provide the raw material for evidence synthesis and insight generation
- Each data point must be traceable back to its source session for complete auditability
- Data confidence levels help assess evidence quality and maturity
- Data objects can be tagged and categorized to support pattern recognition and synthesis
