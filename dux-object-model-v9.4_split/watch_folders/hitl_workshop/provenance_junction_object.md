# ðŸ§¬ Provenance Junction Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
A **Provenance Junction** represents the connection between a **Session** and **Data** object, creating a traceable evidence molecule with freshness assessment. It serves as the bridge that links raw research activities to specific evidence points, enabling complete auditability and evidence maturity tracking.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to create a traceable link between a research session and the specific data it generated, I want to establish a provenance junction that captures the evidence freshness and context, so that I can assess the quality and reliability of research findings and maintain complete audit trails.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Provenance Junction Object Matters
- Creates atomic evidence molecules with full traceability to source sessions
- Enables evidence freshness assessment through maturity scoring
- Provides the foundation for evidence quality evaluation and validation
- Supports evidence synthesis and pattern recognition across multiple sources
- Allows researchers to validate claims through direct reference to original research activities

## ðŸ”— Structural Role & Usage Notes
- A **Provenance Junction** creates the atomic evidence molecule by linking **Session** and **Data** objects
- Evidence maturity is calculated based on the quality and freshness of the source session and data
- Confidence scores help researchers assess the reliability of evidence for decision-making
- Triangulation count tracks how many independent sources support the same evidence
- Validation status ensures evidence quality control and governance
- Provenance junctions provide the foundation for evidence synthesis into larger insights
