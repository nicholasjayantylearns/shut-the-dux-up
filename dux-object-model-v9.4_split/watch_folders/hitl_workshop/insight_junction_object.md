# ðŸ’¡ Insight Junction Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
An **Insight Junction** represents the connection between an **Evidence** object and a **Frame** object, creating a strategic insight with a fit score that measures how well the evidence aligns with the frame. It serves as the synthesis point where evidence is evaluated through strategic lenses to generate actionable insights that inform business decisions.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to evaluate how well evidence fits a strategic frame and generate actionable insights, I want to create an insight junction that measures alignment and synthesizes findings, so that I can prioritize research insights based on their strategic relevance and business impact.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Insight Junction Object Matters
- Measures strategic alignment between evidence and business frames through fit scoring
- Synthesizes evidence into actionable insights with clear business context
- Enables prioritization of research findings based on strategic relevance
- Supports evidence-driven decision making with quantified confidence
- Creates the bridge between research activities and business strategy
