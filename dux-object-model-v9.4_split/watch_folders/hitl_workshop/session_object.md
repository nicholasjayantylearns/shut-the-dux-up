# ðŸŽ¬ Session Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
A **Session** represents the atomic unit of a research study - a single, discrete interaction or observation event that generates raw research data. It serves as the foundational building block for all research activities, capturing the moment when data is created through interviews, observations, surveys, or other research methods.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to capture a discrete research interaction or observation, I want to record the atomic unit of data generation with full context and metadata, so that I can trace all research findings back to their original source and maintain complete auditability of the research process.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Session Object Matters
- Provides atomic traceability for all research data and findings
- Enables complete audit trails from insights back to original research events
- Supports research quality assessment through standardized session metadata
- Creates the foundation for evidence maturity tracking and provenance chains
- Allows researchers to validate and triangulate findings across multiple sessions

## ðŸ”— Structural Role & Usage Notes
- A **Session** is the atomic unit that generates **Data** objects through research activities
- Multiple sessions can be grouped into a **Study** collection for broader research initiatives
- Sessions link to **Provenance** objects through the Data objects they generate
- Session metadata provides essential context for evidence maturity assessment
- All research findings must be traceable back to specific sessions for auditability
- Session status tracking enables research workflow management and quality control
