# ðŸ“š Study Object

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Strategic Role
A **Study** represents a collection of **Session** objects organized around a common research objective or initiative. It serves as the organizational unit that groups related research activities, enabling researchers to manage and analyze multiple sessions as part of a cohesive research program.

## ðŸ§  "What would you say... you do here?"
> When I need to organize multiple research sessions around a common objective, I want to create a study collection that groups related activities and tracks overall progress, so that I can manage research initiatives systematically and generate comprehensive insights from multiple data sources.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Study Object Matters
- Provides organizational structure for managing multiple research sessions
- Enables systematic tracking of research progress and completion
- Supports comprehensive analysis across multiple sessions and participants
- Creates the foundation for research program management and reporting
- Allows researchers to maintain context and continuity across research activities
